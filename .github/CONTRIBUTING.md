## Style Guidelines

### Code Style

- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Follow the existing code style (enforced by Biome)
- Write meaningful commit messages
- Keep functions small and focused
- Add comments for complex logic

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

Examples:

```
Add user onboarding flow

- Create multi-step preference form
- Add API endpoint for saving preferences
- Update UI components

Fixes #123
```

## Testing

Before submitting a pull request, make sure:

```bash
# Lint your code
pnpm lint

# Format your code
pnpm format

# Run tests (when available)
pnpm test
```

## Documentation

- Update the README.md if you change functionality
- Update PROGRESS.md for feature completions
